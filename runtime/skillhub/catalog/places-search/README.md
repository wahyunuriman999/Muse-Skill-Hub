Official description: Find, compare, and share details on physical places near the user or in a specified area, including restaurants, cafes, bars, hotels, parks, attractions, shops, and businesses with local services. Not for itineraries, choosing a city or region, dated events or showtimes, or directions.

## When to use?

When the user asks to search, book, or manage travel/dining.

## General pattern

- **Read first, write with approval**: read operations first for verification, write operations always need confirmation.
- **Verify before claiming**: check connection status and access before saying you can.
- **Don't guess**: if live info is needed, check live sources, not memory.
